# Descriptive Statistics Notebook Strategy
This document defines the steps and strategy to be used and implemented to complete the descriptive statistics analysis.

## Libraries Required
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Organization
- The notebook analysis will be performed in the `notebooks/` folder
- The functions used to perform the analysis will be in the `src/utils/` folder.

### Utility Functions
- Load Data
- Dataset Inspection
  - Shape
  - Data Type
  - Any missing data
  - Duplications
  - Memory usage
    - how much RAM the dataframe consumes
    - `df.memory_usage(deep=True)`
    - `df.info(memory_usage='deep')`
  - Unique values (select columns)
  - Dataset validation checks
    - Validate that dataset columns contain expected structures, values, and datatypes.
    - are the columns present?
    - are they spelled correctly?
    - are the data types correct (ie: datestamp, float, etc.)
  - **Validate Value Ranges**
    - Example:
      - pressure should not be:
      - negative
      - 9000 psi
      - NaN everywhere
  - **Timestamp Validation**
    - Check:
      - timestamps parse correctly,
      - timestamps are ordered,
      - timestamps are unique,
      - timestamps are not missing.
- Data Cleaning
  - missing value handling
  - datatype conversions
  - timestamp parsing
  - duplicate removal
- Descriptive Statistics
  - mean
  - variance
  - standard deviation
- Visualizations
  - histogram
  - box plots
  - distribution plots
  - time series plots
- Time Series Exploration
  - pressure over time
  - rolling mean
  - rolling standard deviation
  - Trend inspection
  - excursion periods

## Notebook Structure

4. Data Cleaning / Validation
5. Descriptive Statistics
6. Distribution Visualization
7. Time-Series Visualization
8. Z-Score Analysis
9. Outlier Investigation
10. Initial Engineering Interpretation

## Special Considerations
This section discusses what should not be included in utils and what the utils should include.

### Utility Functions should NOT be included
- df.shape
- df.describe()
- simple one-line operations.

### Utility Functions SHOULD include
- reusable logic
- repeated workflows
- validation pipelines
- transformations
- plotting logic
- Utility functions should support future logging integration

## Reproducibility
- fixed random seeds where applicable
- deterministic simulations where practical
- documented assumptions
- reproducible plots and outputs

## Future Expansion
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Bayesian estimation
- anomaly detection
- predictive modeling
- infrastructure reliability analysis
